# Private-Public Key Generator

A **Bitcoin private key generator** with `P = k * G`, built in Python using the **secp256k1** elliptic curve. This project allows you to generate a private key, compute the corresponding public key, and understand how ECDSA keys work in Bitcoin.

---

## Features

- Generates a random private key  
- Calculates the corresponding public key using `P = k * G`  
- Uses the secp256k1 curve, as standardized in Bitcoin  
- Pure Python, minimal dependencies

## Installation

Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.

Install the required Python library:

```bash
pip install ecdsa
```
Once you installed it on your terminal (Command Prompt for windows) you can execute the program
